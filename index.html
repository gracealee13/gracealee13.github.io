  <p> <i>Hi y'all!</i> My name is Grace Lee, and I'm a digital marketer and new mom with a passion for people. Over the past decade, I've been exposed to multiple incredibly different industries &ndash; Corporate Retail, Commercial Real Estate, and Cybersecurity &ndash; and roles/responsibilities ranging from sales to marketing, client management, and everything in between; the common thread that brings all these experiences together is <i>relationships</i>. I strongly believe that in the professional world, we are all in the business of people. I strive to keep this top-of-mind in any role I take on and any team I join. </p>
  <p> As can be gleaned from my educational pursuits in both economics and marketing, I possess a unique balance between left- and right-brain tendencies. I have a passion for design, creativity, and making things beautiful; at the same time, I am data-driven and skilled in analytics, passionate about learning new languages (both spoken and programming), and incredibly detail-oriented. This uncommon combination of skills and passions coupled with an extremely gregarious personality has produced a malleability that has allowed me to adapt to and thrive in various roles across diverse industries. Ultimately, I aspire to build a career and a life centered on using these unique capabilities to serve others. </p>
  <p> A proud graduate of The University of Alabama, the zeal for my alma mater's football team is a fitting parallel and really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my drive for excellence. I strive to produce quality work that exceeds expectations in anything I do &ndash; whether work-related projects or cooking meals for my family. In recent years, I've also been expanding my horizons beyond my comfort zone to really stretch my understanding of the world around me. Marrying into an immigrant family, for example, has taught me so much about many cultures and backgrounds I had never before seeked to explore and understand. </p>
  <p> I hope this gives you a glimpse into who I am and opens the door for new conversations and relationships. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, feedback, or professional inquiries. Thank you for reading, and have a blessed day! </p>
